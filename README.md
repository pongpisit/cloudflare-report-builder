# Cloudflare Report Builder

Generate polished, data-rich PDF/HTML reports straight from live Cloudflare
analytics — either a **Security (AppSec) report** for a single zone, or a
**Zero Trust / Cloudflare One report** for an account — complete with an
AI-written executive summary, charts, and prioritized recommendations. Built
entirely as a Cloudflare Worker + static frontend: no external servers, no
database to manage beyond Cloudflare's own D1/R2.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/pongpisit/cloudflare-report-builder)

> Built for Cloudflare partners, SEs, and customers who want a Proof-of-Concept
> or recurring security assessment report generated from *real* Cloudflare
> data — not a mock-up. Every metric in every report traces back to a live
> GraphQL Analytics, REST, or analytics API call.

**At a glance:** ~$5/month to run (the Workers Paid subscription — see
[Cost](#cost)), under a cent of marginal cost per report, ~30 seconds to
generate a report, and no infrastructure to operate.

## What it does

Paste in a Cloudflare API token (yours, scoped read-only, never stored) and
generate:

- **AppSec report** (per zone) — WAF, DDoS, Bot Management, DNS, Cache/CDN,
  SSL/TLS, Rate Limiting, API Shield, Page Shield, Email Security (SPF/DKIM/DMARC),
  AI Crawl Control, AI Security for Apps (prompt injection / PII / unsafe
  topics), Leaked Credential Check, Content Scanning, and a computed Security
  Posture Score — 20+ sections in total.
- **Zero Trust / Cloudflare One report** (per account) — Access apps &
  policies, authentication events & anomalies, Gateway DNS/HTTP/Network (L4)
  filtering with real session health & top Cloudflare locations, Shadow IT
  discovery (SaaS + Private Network), Generative AI usage (via Cloudflare's
  own category classification, not keyword guessing), WARP device posture
  with real online/offline status, Tunnel health, DLP & CASB findings, and a
  Zero Trust posture score. Mirrors the layout of Cloudflare's own **Zero
  Trust → Insights → Dashboards** catalog.
- An **AI executive summary** (Workers AI) for both report types, with
  distinct wording for a "Proof-of-Concept" pitch vs. a neutral recurring
  "Assessment" report.
- **Finding lifecycle tracking** (D1-backed) — remediation register, CASB
  finding register, and alert investigation register carry status, owner, age
  and occurrence count across report runs, and auto-resolve when the
  underlying condition clears.
- Optional **scheduled email delivery** (daily/weekly/monthly, or the exact
  previous calendar month) of either report type via Cloudflare Email
  Sending, with a full run history.
- An **audit archive** of every generated report (R2), listable and
  re-viewable later.

**No mock data, ever.** See
[Data sources and honesty guarantees](#data-sources-and-honesty-guarantees).

## What you need

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version / detail | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** | 18 or later (20 LTS+ recommended) | Vite 5 and Wrangler 4 both require Node 18+ |
| **npm** | 8+ (npm workspaces) | The repo is a two-workspace monorepo (`apps/api`, `apps/web`) |
| **Cloudflare account** | **Workers Paid ($5/mo minimum)** | Required — see [below](#why-workers-paid-is-required) |
| **Wrangler** | Installed automatically as a devDependency | No global install needed; all commands use `npx wrangler` |
| **Cloudflare API token** | Read-only, scoped — see [token permissions](#cloudflare-api-token-permissions) | Supplies the report data. You paste it in the UI per report; it is never stored |
| **A sending domain** | Only for scheduled email reports | Must be onboarded to Cloudflare Email Sending |

Everything else (the D1 database, R2 bucket, Workers AI binding, cron
trigger) is provisioned by the deploy — you do not need to install or operate
a database, queue, or server.

### Why Workers Paid is required

This is not an upsell — the app genuinely cannot run on the Workers Free
plan. Three independent hard limits are exceeded, all measured or verified
against [Cloudflare's published limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/):

| Limit | Workers Free | This app needs | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Subrequests per invocation** | 50 | **~75–120** Cloudflare API calls per report | Code: 18 config + up to 50 Access-policy + 48 analytics calls (Zero Trust); 71+ (AppSec) |
| **CPU time per invocation** | 10 ms | **154 ms** measured for one full Zero Trust report | Measured via `wrangler tail` (see [Performance](#performance-and-platform-limits)) |
| **Workers AI model access** | Some models are Paid-only | Primary summary model `@cf/zai-org/glm-5.3-flash` is on Cloudflare's paid-billing list | [Workers AI pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/platform/pricing/) |

Additionally, **Email Sending to arbitrary recipients requires Workers Paid**
(sending to verified destination addresses in your own account is free on any
plan), so scheduled email reports need it too.

The Workers Paid plan is a flat **$5/month minimum for the whole account**,
and — as the [Cost](#cost) section shows with measured numbers — realistic
usage of this app fits inside the included allowances, so $5/month is
typically the entire bill.

## Components

One `wrangler deploy` produces a single Worker that owns everything below.
There is no separate server, container, or VM.

| Component | Binding | What it does | Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Worker** (Hono) | — | All report generation, API routes, cron entrypoint. Entry: `apps/api/src/index.ts` | Yes |
| **Static Assets** | `[assets]` | Serves the built React SPA (`apps/web/dist`) from the same origin as the API — one URL, no CORS | Yes |
| **D1** (SQLite) | `DB` | Schedule config, send history, backend settings, KPI snapshots, and the remediation / CASB / alert registers — 7 tables | Yes (created by deploy) |
| **R2** | `AUDIT_BUCKET` | Audit archive of rendered report HTML | Optional — only the archive feature needs it |
| **Workers AI** | `AI` | Executive summaries (3-model fallback chain) | Optional — reports render without summaries |
| **Email Sending** | `EMAIL` | Delivers scheduled report digests | Optional — only for scheduled emails |
| **Cron Trigger** | `0 * * * *` | Hourly due-check for scheduled reports | Optional — harmless if unused |

### Architecture

```
                    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
                    │   Cloudflare Worker (Hono)               │
   User's browser   │   apps/api/src/index.ts                  │
  ───────────────── │                                          │
  GET  /            │   [assets] → serves apps/web/dist (SPA)  │
  GET  /api/*  ──────►  REST + GraphQL fetchers → Cloudflare API│
  GET  /health      │   D1 (schedules/registers)  R2 (audit)   │
                    │   Workers AI (executive summary)         │
                    │   Cron (hourly) → scheduled email digest │
                    └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

`run_worker_first = ["/api/*", "/health"]` means those paths always execute
the Worker; every other path is served as a static asset first, falling back
to `index.html` for SPA routing. A separate-Pages-project topology is also
supported — see [Alternative: separate Pages frontend](#alternative-separate-pages-frontend).

**Stack:** Hono (API), React 18 + Vite 5 + Tailwind 3 + Recharts + D3
(frontend), TypeScript throughout.

## Cost

Cloudflare pricing verified against the official docs (Workers, Workers AI,
D1, R2, and Email Service pricing pages) as of the last README update.
**Always confirm current rates** — Cloudflare pricing changes, and the
figures below are estimates, not a quote.

### Measured resource usage

These are real measurements from this app, not estimates:

| Metric | Measured value | How |
|---|---|---|
| Worker CPU time per report | **154 ms** | `wrangler tail` on a full Zero Trust report against a large production account |
| Worker wall-clock time per report | **~29 s** | Same run — the Worker is I/O-bound waiting on ~100 Cloudflare API calls |
| Cloudflare API calls per report | **~75–120** | Counted in code (`Promise.allSettled` fan-out) |
| Report JSON payload | **~167 KB** | Same run |
| AI summary, CPU time | **9 ms** | Effectively all wall-time is waiting on Workers AI |
| AI summary, wall time | **~10 s (typical) – 113 s (worst case)** | Worst case measured: both reasoning models exhausted their token budget and the third fallback produced the summary |
| Archived report in R2 | **~2.8 MB** median | Median of 37 real archived objects |

### Per-unit rates and included allowances

| Component | Included (Workers Paid) | Rate above included | What this app consumes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Workers subscription** | — | **$5.00 / month** (account minimum) | Flat |
| Workers requests | 10 M / month | $0.30 / million | 1 request per report |
| Workers CPU time | 30 M CPU-ms / month | $0.02 / million CPU-ms | 154 ms per report → **~195,000 reports/month** fit in the included CPU |
| Static asset requests | Unlimited, free | — | The whole frontend |
| **Workers AI** | 10,000 Neurons / **day** | $0.011 / 1,000 Neurons | ~170 Neurons per summary (best case), ~700 (worst case, all 3 models) |
| **D1** | 5 GB storage, 25 B rows read, 50 M rows written / month | $0.75/GB-mo, $0.001/M read, $1.00/M written | Kilobytes; a handful of rows per report |
| **R2** | 10 GB-month, 1 M Class A, 10 M Class B ops | $0.015/GB-mo, $4.50/M Class A, $0.36/M Class B | ~2.8 MB per archived report → **~3,600 archived reports** fit in the free tier |
| **Email Sending** | 3,000 outbound emails / month | $0.35 / 1,000 emails | 1 email per scheduled recipient |

### Marginal cost per report

| Line item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Worker CPU (154 ms × $0.02/M ms) | $0.000003 |
| AI executive summary | $0.002 (best case) – $0.008 (worst case, 3 models) |
| R2 archive (2.8 MB, per month stored) | $0.00004 |
| **Total** | **well under $0.01 per report** |

### Realistic monthly scenarios

| Scenario | Reports/month | Estimated bill |
|---|---|---|
| **Solo SE / partner** — 20 interactive reports, 4 scheduled emails, all archived | 24 | **$5.00** — everything inside included allowances |
| **Active team** — 200 reports, 50 scheduled emails, all archived | 200 | **$5.00** — ~7 reports/day × ~700 Neurons stays under the 10,000/day AI allowance, so still just the subscription |
| **Heavy automation** — 1,000 reports/month, all with AI summaries | 1,000 | **~$9.50** — ~33 reports/day exceeds the daily AI allowance; ~406,000 billable Neurons/month ≈ $4.46. Workers CPU (154,000 ms), R2 (2.8 GB) and email all remain inside included limits |

**The practical takeaway:** the Workers Paid subscription is the bill. Usage
is close to a rounding error at any volume a human actually reviews reports
at. The one dimension that scales is Workers AI — and because the free
allowance resets *daily* (10,000 Neurons/day ≈ 14 worst-case or 59 best-case
summaries per day), steady usage often stays free.

**Not included above:** your Cloudflare *plan* costs. The reports read data
from products you already pay for (a zone plan, Cloudflare One seats,
Enterprise add-ons like API Shield or Page Shield). This tool adds no
licensing cost to those — it only reads their analytics.

---

## Quick start — Deploy to Cloudflare

Click the button above. Cloudflare will fork this repo into your GitHub
account, provision a D1 database + R2 bucket, bind Workers AI, and deploy
the Worker (which also serves the frontend). That's the whole report
builder — interactive AppSec + Zero Trust reports work immediately with no
further setup, since you supply your own Cloudflare API token directly in
the UI for those.

### Post-deploy steps (optional — only for scheduled email reports)

Scheduled reports need a backend-bound token and sender email, since the
cron job runs with nobody in the browser to supply a token interactively.

```bash
# 1. Bind a Cloudflare API token the scheduler will use to generate reports
#    (same permissions as the interactive report builder — see tables below).
#    The dashboard's Settings page can also set/rotate this without a redeploy.
npx wrangler secret put CF_API_TOKEN

# 2. Onboard a sending domain for Cloudflare Email Sending.
npx wrangler email sending enable yourdomain.com
```

Then set `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` and `EMAIL_FROM` either in `wrangler.toml`'s
`[vars]` (requires a redeploy) or in the app's **Settings** dashboard
(applies instantly, no redeploy — see `apps/api/src/services/settings.ts`).

### ⚠️ Protect the dashboard before going further

The **Scheduled Reports** and **Settings** pages are **not authenticated by
design** — anyone who can reach your Worker's URL can view/change schedule
configuration and the masked settings state (never the raw token — see
[Security](#security)). Put this Worker behind
[Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/)
before sharing the URL with anyone but yourself. `/api/me` already reads the
Access-authenticated user's email for you once Access is in front.

---

## Manual deployment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/cloudflare-report-builder.git
cd cloudflare-report-builder
npm install

# One-time: create the D1 database and record its ID locally (never committed)
npx wrangler d1 create poc-report-schedules
cp wrangler.local.example.toml wrangler.local.toml
# → paste the returned database_id into wrangler.local.toml

npm run deploy   # builds the frontend, runs D1 migrations, deploys the Worker
```

`npm run deploy` (see `scripts/deploy.sh`) automatically uses
`wrangler.local.toml` instead of the committed `wrangler.toml` template when
present — this is how you can keep redeploying to your own already-provisioned
resources without ever committing their IDs to git.

---

## How the build works

There are two independent build products: the **frontend bundle** (built by
Vite, ahead of time) and the **Worker bundle** (built by Wrangler at deploy
time). Understanding the order matters, because the Worker serves the
frontend's output directory as static assets — so the frontend must be built
*first*.

### 1. Frontend build — `npm run build`

Runs `npm run build --workspace=apps/web`, which is `tsc -b && vite build`:

1. `tsc -b` type-checks `apps/web` using project references (fails the build
   on any type error — there is no `noEmitOnError` escape hatch).
2. `vite build` bundles React + Tailwind into `apps/web/dist`, with manual
   vendor chunk splitting configured in `apps/web/vite.config.ts`
   (`vendor-react`, `vendor-recharts`, `vendor-icons`, `vendor-d3`) so the
   large charting libraries cache separately from app code.

Typical output (~2 MB total, ~550 KB gzipped):

```
dist/index.html                       0.99 kB │ gzip:   0.46 kB
dist/assets/index-*.css              43.39 kB │ gzip:   8.25 kB
dist/assets/vendor-d3-*.js            8.24 kB │ gzip:   2.84 kB
dist/assets/vendor-icons-*.js        39.76 kB │ gzip:   9.12 kB
dist/assets/vendor-recharts-*.js    559.77 kB │ gzip: 156.13 kB
dist/assets/index-*.js            1,348.52 kB │ gzip: 376.61 kB
```

Vite warns that the main chunk exceeds 600 kB. That is expected and
accepted: a report page legitimately mounts dozens of chart sections, and
this is an internal reporting tool where a one-time ~380 kB gzipped download
is a better trade than the complexity of lazy-loading every section.

### 2. D1 migrations

`npx wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --remote` applies anything in
`migrations/` not yet recorded in the database's migration table. Migrations
are additive and safe to re-run (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE
ADD COLUMN` with defaults):

| Migration | Adds |
|---|---|
| `0001_init.sql` | `schedules`, `send_history` |
| `0002_settings.sql` | `settings` (backend token + account, dashboard-managed) |
| `0003_zt_snapshots.sql` | `zt_report_snapshots` (period-over-period KPI baselines) |
| `0004_zt_remediation.sql` | `zt_remediation_items` (finding lifecycle) |
| `0005_zt_casb_findings.sql` | `zt_casb_findings` (CASB finding lifecycle) |
| `0006_zt_alert_tracking.sql` | `zt_alert_tracking` (alert investigation register) |
| `0007_schedule_range_mode.sql` | `schedules.range_mode` (rolling vs. calendar month) |

### 3. Worker build and deploy

`npx wrangler deploy` bundles `apps/api/src/index.ts` with esbuild (no
separate build step or config needed) and uploads it together with
`apps/web/dist` as static assets. Current bundle size and startup time:

```
Total Upload: 509.20 KiB / gzip: 108.68 KiB
Worker Startup Time: 13 ms
```

Both are far inside the platform limits (64 MiB uncompressed bundle, 1 s
startup).

### Putting it together

`npm run deploy` → `scripts/deploy.sh` runs all three steps in order:

```bash
npm run build                                          # 1. frontend → apps/web/dist
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --remote --config …  # 2. schema
npx wrangler deploy --config …                          # 3. worker + assets
```

To inspect the Worker bundle without deploying:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir /tmp/out
```

### Type checking

```bash
npm run typecheck    # apps/api (tsc --noEmit) + apps/web (tsc -b)
npm run cf-typegen   # regenerate worker-configuration.d.ts after editing wrangler.toml
```

`worker-configuration.d.ts` is the generated ambient `Env` type (bindings,
vars, secrets). Regenerate it whenever you add or rename a binding, or
TypeScript will not know about it.

---

## Local development

```bash
npm install

# Terminal 1 — Worker API (uses wrangler.toml)
npm run dev:api          # wrangler dev, http://localhost:8787

# Terminal 2 — Vite dev server with hot reload (proxies /api → :8787)
npm run dev:web          # http://localhost:5173
```

Develop against `http://localhost:5173` — Vite proxies `/api` to the Worker
on port 8787 (configured in `apps/web/vite.config.ts`), so the frontend and
API behave as same-origin exactly like production.

Notes:

- `npm run dev:api` is plain `wrangler dev` and therefore reads
  **`wrangler.toml`**, not `wrangler.local.toml`. Only `scripts/deploy.sh`
  prefers the local override. To develop against your own provisioned
  resources, run `npx wrangler dev --config wrangler.local.toml`.
- Workers AI and Email Sending bindings call the real remote services even in
  local dev; D1 and R2 default to local emulation unless you pass `--remote`.
- To serve the built SPA from `wrangler dev` (instead of Vite), run
  `npm run build` first so `apps/web/dist` exists.

---

## Configuration reference

### Vars (`[vars]` in `wrangler.toml`, or the Settings dashboard)

| Name | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | No | `"production"` | Informational; surfaced by `/health` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | No | `""` | Extra allowed CORS origins (comma-separated). Only needed if the frontend runs on a **different** origin than the Worker |
| `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` | For scheduled reports | `""` | Account the scheduler and zone picker use. Backend-only — never sent from the browser |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | For scheduled emails | `""` | Sender address; its domain must be onboarded to Email Sending |

### Secrets (`npx wrangler secret put <NAME>`)

| Name | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CF_API_TOKEN` | For scheduled reports | Token the cron job uses to generate reports. Write-only — never readable back out |

Interactive reports need **neither** of these: the user supplies their own
token and account/zone in the form.

### Dashboard-managed settings (D1, no redeploy)

The **Settings** page writes to the `settings` table and takes precedence
over the env var / secret. This lets you rotate the backend token or change
the account without redeploying. The API only ever returns a masked hint
(`••••1234`), never the stored value. See `apps/api/src/services/settings.ts`.

### Precedence

```
D1 settings (dashboard)  >  Worker secret / [vars]  >  unset (feature disabled)
```

---

## Cloudflare API token permissions

Create a token at **My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token → Custom Token**.
"Optional" permissions unlock specific sections; the report renders fine
without them (that section just shows an honest empty state).

## Security

- **Interactive reports**: your API token is sent once per report-generation
  request, held only in memory for that request, and never written to D1,
  R2, or logs. Nothing is stored server-side unless you explicitly click
  "Save to Audit Archive" (which stores the *rendered report HTML*, not the
  token).
- **Scheduled reports**: the token used by the cron job is either a Worker
  secret (`CF_API_TOKEN`, set via `wrangler secret put`, never readable back
  out) or stored in D1 via the Settings dashboard (masked in every API
  response — only a `••••1234`-style hint is ever returned, never the full
  value).
- **Unauthenticated by design, protect it yourself**: `/api/schedules/*` and
  `/api/settings/*` have no built-in auth check — they're meant to sit behind
  [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/)
  (or an equivalent) in front of the Worker. `/api/me` reads the
  `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email` header / `CF_Authorization` JWT cookie
  if Access is configured, purely for attribution in the audit archive — it
  is **not** an authorization check.
- **Rate limiting**: the expensive routes (`/api/appsec`, `/api/zerotrust`,
  `/api/summary`, `/api/zt-summary`, `/api/schedules/:id/send`,
  `/api/settings/test`) are capped at **50 requests / 5 minutes per source
  IP** (in-memory, per-isolate — a coarse guard, not a substitute for
  Access).
- **Never commit resource IDs or tokens**: `wrangler.local.toml` and
  `.env.test` are gitignored. The committed `wrangler.toml` deliberately
  contains no `account_id` or `database_id`.

## Performance and platform limits

Measured on a large production Cloudflare One account:

| Aspect | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Report generation | **~23–30 s** wall, **154 ms** CPU | I/O-bound on ~75–120 upstream Cloudflare API calls, fanned out with `Promise.allSettled` |
| AI executive summary | ~10 s typical, **up to ~113 s** worst case | Model fallback chain; see [AI models](#ai-models) |
| Subrequests per report | ~75–120 | Paid-plan limit is 10,000 — plenty of headroom |
| CPU per report | 154 ms | Paid-plan default limit is 30 s per request |
| Cron invocation | Hourly | Cron Triggers get 15 min wall time, 30 s CPU (<1 h interval) |

**Client timeouts are the real constraint, not Cloudflare's.** A report plus
a worst-case AI summary can exceed two minutes. If you script against the
API, set a generous timeout (`curl --max-time 170` or similar). The
browser UI already handles this with progress state.

Two upstream API constraints worth knowing:

- **Gateway DNS breakdown data has a ~4-week retention wall.** Cloudflare's
  `gatewayResolverQueriesAdaptiveGroups` GraphQL dataset rejects any query
  whose `since` is more than ~4 weeks before *now*, regardless of the
  requested upper bound. Headline DNS totals come from a newer analytics API
  with no such limit, so they stay accurate; only the detailed breakdown
  widgets (top domains, categories, resolver mix, daily trend) can come back
  empty for an older calendar month. The report says so inline via
  `dataConfidence` rather than rendering a misleading blank chart.
- **`/devices?per_page=500` is intermittently flaky on large fleets.** Device
  counts fall back through REST `total_count` → GraphQL
  `warpLatestStatus.total` → DNS analytics `uniqueDeviceCount`, taking the
  maximum.

---

## Scheduled email reports

An hourly cron (`[triggers]` in `wrangler.toml`) checks for due schedules,
generates the report with the backend-bound token, writes a Workers AI
executive summary, renders an email-safe HTML digest, and sends it via the
Email Sending binding. Everything is configured from the **Scheduled
Reports** dashboard — report type, zone/account, timeframe, cadence,
recipients, subject, and an optional custom message.

- **Cadence**: daily / weekly / monthly, evaluated in the schedule's
  captured timezone. A 90-minute grace window after the intended send time
  doubles as catch-up if a cron event is missed.
- **Timeframe**: a rolling window (1/3/5/7/14/30 days) **or "Last Month"**,
  which reports the exact previous calendar month with its real day count
  (28–31) and a proper period label like "August 2026". Prefer this for
  monthly schedules — a fixed 30-day window silently drifts against real
  month boundaries.
- **Double-send guard**: an atomic `last_run_at` claim (compared against the
  intended occurrence, not wall-clock time) prevents duplicate sends.
- **"Send test now"**: generates and sends immediately, recorded as a
  `manual` run in history — use this to verify recipients/formatting before
  trusting the cron.
- **Archive**: every scheduled send's rendered HTML is snapshotted to the
  R2 audit bucket under `scheduled/`.
- See `apps/api/src/scheduler.ts` for the full implementation.

## AI models

Executive summaries use a three-tier Workers AI fallback chain, since large
reasoning models can occasionally exhaust their token budget mid-thought
before writing any output (`finish_reason: "length"`, empty content) —
confirmed live, non-deterministically, on prompts built from larger real
reports:

1. `@cf/zai-org/glm-5.3-flash` (primary, `max_tokens: 3000`)
2. `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b` (fallback, `max_tokens: 3000`)
3. `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast` (final fallback, `max_tokens: 2000`)

A response shorter than a real 5-paragraph summary (`MIN_VALID_SUMMARY_LENGTH
= 300` chars) is treated as a failure and the next model is tried. In the rare
case all three fail, report generation still succeeds — only the executive
summary is omitted (or, in the UI, shown as an explicit "AI summary
unavailable" error rather than silently blank).

This chain is not theoretical. A logged real run:

```
[AI] @cf/zai-org/glm-5.3-flash returned empty/truncated (0 chars): finish_reason "length"
[AI] @cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b returned empty/truncated (0 chars): finish_reason "length"
→ @cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast produced a 490-word summary
```

Both reasoning models spent their entire budget on `reasoning_content` and
emitted no answer; the third model delivered. Total wall time 113 s. This is
expected behavior, not a hang — and it is why the chain exists.

## Data sources and honesty guarantees

Every chart is backed by a real Cloudflare GraphQL Analytics dataset, REST
endpoint, or analytics API — documented inline in the source next to every
fetcher (`apps/api/src/services/`). The project holds itself to three rules:

1. **No fabricated numbers.** Where a metric genuinely cannot be sourced from
   a real Cloudflare API, the report renders an honest empty state instead of
   a plausible-looking value.
2. **Dashboard parity.** Headline KPIs are sourced from the same endpoints
   Cloudflare's own dashboard uses (`apps/api/src/services/cf-dashboard-analytics.ts`),
   so the report's numbers match what the customer sees when they log in. For
   example, WARP client session events and service-token validations are
   excluded from "authentication events" (and surfaced separately) rather than
   inflating the headline.
3. **Explicit uncertainty.** When an upstream API limit degrades a section, a
   `dataConfidence` note explains exactly why — see the DNS breakdown
   retention wall in [Performance and platform limits](#performance-and-platform-limits).

Each `/analytics/query/*` call fails soft to the older GraphQL/REST source,
so a breaking upstream change degrades a section rather than breaking the
report.

## Alternative: separate Pages frontend

If you'd rather deploy the frontend as its own Cloudflare Pages project
(e.g. to put it on a different custom domain than the Worker), the
`apps/web/functions/api/[[path]].ts` reverse-proxy Function is included for
exactly that:

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=your-project-name
```

Then set `API_WORKER_URL` as a **Pages environment variable** (dashboard →
Settings → Environment variables) pointing at your deployed Worker's URL. In
this topology, also set `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` in the Worker's `wrangler.toml` to
your Pages URL so CORS allows it.

## Project structure

```
apps/api/                  Cloudflare Worker (Hono) — all report generation logic
  src/index.ts               Route table + rate limiting + CORS
  src/routes/                HTTP handlers (appsec, zerotrust, summaries, schedules,

```

---

## Testing

```bash
npm run typecheck       # tsc --noEmit (api) + tsc -b (web)
npm run test:e2e        # Playwright — see tests/e2e/
npm run test:e2e:ui     # interactive runner
npm run test:e2e:report # open the last HTML report
```

Live/browser E2E tests need real credentials in `.env.test` (copy from
`.env.test.example` — never committed).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `Worker exceeded resource limits` (Error 1102) | You are on the Workers **Free** plan (10 ms CPU / 50 subrequests). This app needs Workers Paid — see [Why Workers Paid is required](#why-workers-paid-is-required) |
| Report request times out in your client | Generation takes ~30 s, and a worst-case AI summary up to ~113 s. Raise your client timeout (`curl --max-time 170`) |
| AI summary missing or "unavailable" | All three models failed, or Workers AI's 10,000 Neurons/day allowance is exhausted. The report itself still generates |
| `403` / error 5035 from Workers AI | `@cf/zai-org/glm-5.3-flash` requires paid billing. Upgrade to Workers Paid or use AI Gateway credits |
| A report section is empty | Usually a missing optional token permission — check the [permission tables](#cloudflare-api-token-permissions). Empty states are deliberate, never faked |
| DNS breakdown charts empty on a "Last Month" report | Expected: Cloudflare's DNS breakdown GraphQL dataset only retains ~4 weeks. Headline DNS totals are still accurate. See the `dataConfidence` note in the report |
| Scheduled reports never send | Check `CF_API_TOKEN` (or Settings), `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`, `EMAIL_FROM`, that the sending domain is onboarded, and the schedule's run history for the recorded error |
| `wrangler dev` ignores my D1 database | `npm run dev:api` reads `wrangler.toml`. Use `npx wrangler dev --config wrangler.local.toml` |
| Deploy fails on missing `database_id` | Run `npx wrangler d1 create poc-report-schedules` and put the ID in `wrangler.local.toml` |
| TypeScript doesn't know a new binding | Run `npm run cf-typegen` to regenerate `worker-configuration.d.ts` |
